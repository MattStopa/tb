# Token Bucket (tb) [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/tsenart/tb/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/tsenart/tb/latest) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tsenart/tb?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/tsenart/tb)

This package provides a generic lock-free implementation of the "Token bucket"
algorithm where the handling of non-conformity is left to the user.
Read more about it in this [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket).

## Install
```shell
$ go get github.com/tsenart/tb
```

## Usage examples
### Throttled writer
Example of a ThrottledWriter which satisfies the io.Writer interface.
It handles non-conformity by sleeping 1 second once the bucket is empty.
```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"time"
)

type ThrottledWriter struct {
	tb *Bucket
	w  io.Writer
}

func NewThrottledWriter(rate int64, w io.Writer) io.Writer {
	return &ThrottledWriter{NewBucket(rate), w}
}

func (tw *ThrottledWriter) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	for wr := 0; wr < len(p); {
		in := len(p) - wr
		if out := tw.tb.Take(int64(in)); out == 0 {
			time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
			continue
		} else if n, err = tw.w.Write(p[wr : wr+int(out)]); err != nil {
			return wr, err
		}
		wr += n
	}
	return len(p), nil
}
```

### Echo server
Example of an echo server which throttles client connections per remote
IP address. It handles *non-conformity* by closing the connection.
```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/tsenart/tb"
  "io"
  "log"
  "net"
)

func main() {
	ln, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":6789")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	th := tb.NewThrottler()

	echo := func(conn net.Conn) {
		defer conn.Close()

		host, port, err := net.SplitHostPort(conn.RemoteAddr().String())
		if err != nil {
			panic(err)
		}
		// Throttle to 10 connection per second from the same host
		// Handle non-conformity by dropping the connection
		if out := th.Throttle(host, 1, 10); out < 1 {
			log.Printf("Throttled %s", host)
			return
		}
		log.Printf("Echoing payload from %s:%s", host, port)
		io.Copy(conn, conn)
	}

	for {
		conn, err := ln.Accept()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		go echo(conn)
	}
}
```
