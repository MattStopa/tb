# Throttle

This package provides a generic implementation of the "Token bucket"
algorithm where the handling of non-conformity is left to the user.

## Status: Alpha

## Example
```go
package main

import (
  "time"

  "github.com/tsenart/throttle"
)

func main() {
  rate := 100 // per second
  bucket := throttle.NewBucket(rate)
  work := make(chan int)

  go func() {
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
      work <- i
    }
  }()

  for item := range work {
    if out := bucket.Put(1); out != 1 {
      // handle non-conformant item
      time.Sleep(50 * time.Millisecond)
      work <- item
      continue
    }
    // handle conformant item 
  }
}
```
